Overview:

The Memory Game is a fun and interactive game that challenges players to remember a sequence of colors and repeat it correctly. Each round, the game adds a new color to the sequence, making it increasingly difficult to recall. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and jQuery, and is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.

2. Gameplay:
   - After starting, the game will display a sequence of colors, one at a time.
   - Your task is to remember the sequence and click/tap the buttons in the correct order.

   - The game continues until you make a mistake by clicking/tapping the wrong button.

3. Game Over:
   - If you click/tap the wrong color, the game will end.
   - The screen will flash red, and a "GAME OVER" message will appear.
   - To restart the game, press any key (on desktop/laptop) or tap the screen (on mobile/tablet).
